### Structure

`}`

### Course

Two parts:
- traditional learning;
- deep learning.

### Home Assignments

3 home assignments ("homeworks"):
- each consist of a number of exercises;
- 2 weeks for submitting homework;
  - each additional week: 0.25 points penalty;
- final score for an assignment:
  $$\max \left[ 1, \sum_i \mathrm{exercise}_i \right] - \mathrm{penalty}$$

~~~center
\textbf{
  Home assignments must be your own work. \\
  Tools allowed for use will be specified in homework descriptions.
}
~~~

### Exam

`\vspace*{5mm}`

Exam:
- a presentation on Machine Learning challenge you took part in:
  - a non-trivial solution;
  - elaborate on method/features/... you chose.
- overview of an advanced Machine Learning paper:
  - some suggestions will be on lectures (under Further Reading etc);
  - a list of preapproved advanced papers will be provided.

~~~center
\textbf{ \large Please, discuss your choice with me beforehand,\\ send me paper/draft of your presentation in advance.}
~~~

### Final grades

$$\text{Final grade} = 50\% \cdot \text{homeworks} + 50\% \cdot \text{exam}$$

$$\text{Final grade} = \left\lceil \frac{5}{3} \cdot \text{homework score} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{exam score} \right\rceil$$
where:
- homework score - sum of all marks for the homeworks (max 1 per each, max 3 in total);
- exam score - mark on the exam, max 10.

### Literature

- Friedman J, Hastie T, Tibshirani R. The elements of statistical learning. New York, NY, USA:: Springer series in statistics; 2001.
- Bishop C. Neural networks for pattern recognition. Oxford university press; 1995 Nov 23.
- Bishop C. Pattern recognition and machine learning.

### Deep Learning course

There is an excellent course on Deep Learning:
- https://www.hse.ru/edu/courses/222120421

which intersects heavily with the program of this course.`\\[5mm]`

If **all** students agree:
- to attend the Deep Learning course;

then:

- this course will be devoted to advanced topics;

otherwise:

- an 'ordinary' (and compressed) Deep Learning course will be presented.
